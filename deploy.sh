# Open Pay — Production Deploy Script (self-contained, shared-host safe)
# Usage: ./deploy.sh [production]
#
# The whole stack (infra + services) runs under the `openpay` compose project
# on its own private network. Nothing is published to the host except the
# gateway on 127.0.0.1:${GATEWAY_BIND_PORT:-7000}, which the host nginx proxies.
# Safe to run alongside other projects on the same box.
